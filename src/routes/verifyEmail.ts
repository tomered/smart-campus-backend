/** -----------DOCUMENTATION-----------
  Email Verification Route

  This route handles the email verification process after a user registers. 
  The user is required to submit the token they received via email along with their email 
  in a POST request. The system then verifies if the token matches the one stored in the database.

  - The token and email are sent as part of the POST request body.
  - The route searches for the user by email in the database.
  - It then compares the token provided by the user with the hashed token stored in the database.
  - If the token is valid, the user's `isEmailVerified` field is set to `true` and the 
    `emailVerificationToken` is cleared (set to null).
  - The userâ€™s updated verification status is saved in the database.

  Key Points:
  - Bcrypt is used to securely compare the stored hashed token and the plain token received from the user.
  - The token is invalidated by setting it to null once it is successfully verified.
  
  @param req - The incoming request object, containing the verification token and email.
  @param res - The response object used to send success or error messages back to the client.

  @throws 400 - If the email or token is invalid or expired.
  @throws 500 - Internal server error in case of exceptions during the verification process.
